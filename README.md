The one-stop web app for teen financial literacy.

# The Problem
Entering the world of credit scores, taxes, stocks, and crypto as a clueless young adult can be scary. Financial literacy rates are significantly lower compared to subjects that are taught in schools, ie. math and English.

# Our solution
What The Finance? (WTF? for short) ($?! for shorter) is the one-stop financial literacy solution for anyone new to the world of money. It offers a friendly and accessible chatbot which responds to questions with summaries of relevant and credible information from the web.

# The build and its challenges
Our website mockup was created in Figma, which was then recreated with vanilla HTML and CSS. The back-end our the project was built with Python and the Selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries. We wanted to make use of the SummarizeBot API, however we couldn't access the free version within the time frame. We worked around this problem by scraping the demo web page for the outputted text summary.

# Next steps for What The Finance
Future implementations will work to make the web app more efficient and expand its features.
